## Questions and Answers Tutorial Backend
This repo is the backend for the [Build a Complete Mobile App with Angular and Ionic demo app](https://github.com/ionicthemes/build-a-complete-mobile-app-with-ionic-framework).

The project was built using [NestJs](https://docs.nestjs.com/).

For the Database we use MongoDB. You need to create your own DB and add the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` in `.env` file.

To host the MongoDB for free we use [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

For any questions regarding this project ping me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dayujabif).

## Install dependencies
`npm install`

## Run the app
`npm run start`

This command starts the app with the HTTP server listening on the port defined in the `src/main.ts` file.
Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.
